      <p>Hi there, my name is Ivan Sander Netto and work as Lead Designer at <a href="avidity.se" class="underlined"><span class="text">Avidity</span><span class="line -regular"></span></a>, a swedish company with a side office in Brazil, here I help to build business and user centred products, localized for users across 25 countries, over 21 different languages.</p>
      <br>
      <p>UX/UI Designer, Front-end, Product Designer, Design Technologist or whatever-you-wanna-call-it…  I am just someone who got tired of the gap between development and design.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A few years ago I decided to look for opportunities where I could play as a facilitator, bridging such areas, looking after of weak spots and making them stronger through the dissemination of knowledge, therefore these persons could understand the reasons behind each area's perspective.</p>
      <br>
      <p>If you are looking for the myth of the genius designer or you even believe on that, I may not be what you are looking for.  I believe in designing and building experiences through the teams’ shared vision and so observing as broader as I can.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I have over 8 years of experience working in both, design and front-end. Working in cross-functional teams has given me great insight into coming up with solutions for many different use cases, as well as improving the workflow and communication between design and engineering teams.</p>

          <p>High quality demands confidence between well-intentioned individuals, for building with such quality, it would be good if any company could approach its different areas with intersections, connecting each others.</p>

          <br>

          <p>That is where I play, bridging the gap between designers, developers, product owners and stakeholders and boosting the knowledge overlaps. It increases productivity and is going to be converted on high quality artfacts.</p>

          <p>In order to incorporate feedback in your daily work, you need to truly empathise with other’s perspective, it requires a good approach at receiving and giving feedback.</p>

          <br>

          <p>Asking questions to spin-up receptivity and verify if you were thinking in the right direction; acknowledging the other person’s perspective - making them know you understand their points; stating a point of view and looping it again until all criteria to succeed is well defined. </p>

          <br>

          <p>This is my formula to walk through feedback.</p>

            <p>I had the pleasure to work with Ivan for a year or so, and got to witness first-hand how great and unique he is at working closely with developers to build and develop user experience. The whole dev team learned from him on a daily basis. He is impressively well versed in design fundamentals, and great at sharing it and building understanding from the ground up with both the clients and the rest of the team. This is the kind of talented, committed and friendly colleague that everybody wants in their team.</p>

            <p>Ivan has the rare ability to create feasible products with great experiences due to his knowledge of front-end and design added to his open-mindedness to tweak his solutions based on what the backend is capable of offering in a given moment. This mindset is essential in any agile team and I have witnessed Ivan’s contribution making a huge impact in crucial and challenging projects. There are people using products that Ivan helped to create and the feedback has been overwhelmingly good. I consider myself lucky to have shared an office and work with him and I am sure anyone would. </p>

            <p>Ivan is an inspirational professional, passionate to perfection where perfection meet reality, one of the crucial skills that most designers that I’ve worked miss the most. His multiple skills lead the team to develop design ideas that can be turned into real solutions, solving real problems, not resumed to only designing but taking steps to deal with improvements while the development occurs.</p>
